    "This 'HDDT - JNB' exercise analyses the persons listed in the index to Protecting the Empire's Humanity (Laidlaw 2021), (PEH), and correspondence received by and correspondence sent to Thomas Hodgkin MD 1799 - 1861, in the indexes to the Wellcome Inst., Hodgkin Family Archives. Selected persons from both archives are then compared with the CEDA database persons. The relationship between the three datasets is then examined to determine the extent to which the networks overlap or fit together; if a Hodgkin political activist network, then emerges, how central is that network to the activism of the wider CEDA network and do insights emerge that might indicate who the key influencers in the network might be?"

    "Laidlaw in the introduction to PEH sets out the importance of the social networks of Dr Thomas Hodgkin MD, “The roots of this book lie in the personal correspondence of the Quaker, scientist, and activist, Dr Thomas Hodgkin”, and “The exploration of Britain’s imperial history presented in this book is profoundly shaped by Thomas Hodgkin’s personal papers, today housed in the Wellcome library in London, and what they reveal of his philanthropic, medical, and scientific interests and networks. The volume and the breadth of that archive has allowed me to trace and assess a wide array of influences on “imperial humanitarianism” (2021, 3). Laidlaw also says that, Hodgkin’s personal archive at the Wellcome Institute constitutes The “backbone” of the book and that “Its study reveals 50 years’ worth of unlikely connections, sustained relationships, and closely argued, if sometimes contradictory, cases” (2021, 7)."

    "Chapter 5 of the thesis argues that by only describing them in narratives it is difficult to 'see' the people who formed the extensive social networks in which Thomas Hodgkin MD operated, how many there were and how they relate to each other. And so, PEH, while discussing at length the efforts of Hodgkin's social networks to relieve the plight of aborigines throughout the British Empire, does not make those networks visible or make them available to scrutiny. This Historical Data Analysis (HDA) fully addresses those two needs and presents new insights about Hodgkin’s networks that are difficult to achieve without an HDDT."

Two members of the QCA who join the APS also join with non QCA members of the APS in joining the ESL in 1843.\n",

In connecting up the QCA, the APS and the ESL these two stand out from the other members of the QCA, (half of whom go on to join the APS) but participate no further in network building. There is no discernible network centered on Hodgkin alone. Thomas Hodgkin's personal network does not appear as a group node. The memberships of the ESL, the Anthropological Society of London (ASL) and Anthropological Institute (AI) are frequently shared. The ESL splits into two groups each of roughly equal size, those who are members of only the ESL and those members of the ESL who also share membership with the AI and ASL. The ASL (formed last in 1863) draws its membership from both the ESL and the AI. It is the ASL that will provide the bulk of the first memberships of the RAI. We can see 'ringed' the small groups of key influencers who network between the CEDA groups."

They appear in this graph in orange. Also in orange is the QCA group. It is helpful to show QCA alongside the two dummy groups because Thomas Hodgkin MD begins his political work in the QCA (as discussed in PEH), and all three groups are arguably Thomas Hodgkin MD groups. ZOE is centre, WEL to the right and QCA to the left. We can see that the dummy groups are centered in the Force Atlas graph and that they connect up all of the main CEDA groups. This is a visible confirmation that the Thomas Hodgkin MD network referenced in PEH is well placed and well connected. The presence of the dummy groups brings Thomas Hodgkin MD to the very centre of the graph, this is impressive given that the entire population is 3337 persons. But it is important to note that Hodgkin does not 'sit' within the community referenced by Laidlaw or that suggested by the WEL analysis, he sits to one side because as much as he is attracted to Laidlaw's and the WEL groups he is 'pulled' away from them because of his connections to the QCA and ESL."

    "This exercise has shown that although Thomas Hodgkin's networks appear only in the index in PEH and in the Wellcome Inst., Hodgkin Archive, in neither of these sources can political activist relationships be easily deduced but, by using data analysis and data visualisation technology thenetworks argued in PEH can be shown and analysed very clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HDDT CEDA db., comprises the 3000 memberships of CEDA societies concerned firstly with the plight of aborigines, but then quickly afterwards with institution building in the science of ethnology and anthropology and within which Thomas Hodgkin was a key influencer. Placing PEH's Hodgkin networks alongside the HDDT networks, a much fuller view of community’s political activism is obtained, where the centrality of Hodgkin's networks to the work of all of the CEDA networks is evident. Clearly, Laidlaw in PEH has in referencing over 100 key networkers, identified those who have close working connections with Hodgkin, and these networks are central to the workings of the greater networks of the CEDA. Other smaller embedded networking groups that liaise between Hodgkin and the CEDA have also been revealed, and these are worthy of further detailed study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although PEH offers a literary description of the networks of Hodgkin, Hodgkin himself does not get subsumed by the Gephi graph algorithms into ZOE or WEL, instead he stands aside. This is because, as we can see, his relationships with Quakers and the APS are strong enough to resist the attraction of his relationships with ZOE or WEL networks. This finding is important because it gives good reason to examine Hodgkin’s relationships further with both QCA and the APS (and the ESL). Six Quakers who are key networkers between Hodgkin's concern for the plight of aborigines and his institution building in the science of anthropology also can be identified and their presence will help to shape the next exercise.\n",

    "Chapter 6 will thoroughly explore the role of Quakers and chapter 7 the role of Hodgkin's networks supporting institution building in ethnology and anthropology within the APS and the ESL.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise confirms and supports the centrality and importance of Hodgkin's networks as set out in the index to PEH and invites further scrutiny of those networks because key individuals and small clusters of persons emerge from the visual analysis.\n"

    "The 'dummy' groups ZOE and WEL, after being scrutinised using a Gephi graph file, add richness and insight into the workings of the CEDA networks and the role of Thomas Hodgkin within those networks. The role of Quakers within these networks is also indicated. Because the new data in ZOE and WEL does not include visual anomalies or reveal a large number of outlying persons (who would add no value to a study of person-to-person networks) we can be confident in now modifying the CEDA database permanently by merging them both into a new CEDA group called HOD. This part of the exercise will be performed in Chapter 5 Part Two."
