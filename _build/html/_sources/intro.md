# Project Seven

Project Seven is a digital study which ran from 2018 to 2024, of the networks of 3000 persons who were members of the Centres for the Discipline of Anthropology (CEDA) in Britain 1830-1870 and the 600 Quakers amongst them.

The CEDA are:
- The Quaker Committee on the Aborigines, QCA - (1831 – 1846)
- The Aborigines Protection Society, APS - (1837 – 1848)
- The Ethnological Society of London, ESL - (1843 – 1848)
- The Anthropological Society of London, ASL - (1861 – 1869)
- The Anthropological Institute, AI – (1871). A merger of the ESL and ASL

The study used the Human Data Digital Toolkit (HDDT) comprising a SQLite database, Gephi Open Graph Visualisation Platform and Jupyter notebooks (JNB) to analyse and visualise Evidence Based Prosopographical information on the members of the CEDA. 
The study was performed by Kelvin Beer-Jones working as a lone researcher, as a part of a PHD project for University of Birmingham: Evidence Based Prosopography in the Digital Study of Past Human Lives.
