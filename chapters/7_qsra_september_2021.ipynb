    "## Subject: ##\n",
    "\n",
    "My own research, in collaboration with others, has revealed the extensive social connectivity between the roughly 600 members of a ‘Quaker Led Network (QLN)’ and their involvement within a community of  roughly 3000, spread across four organisations in Britain active between 1830 and 1870, which the QLN network helped to set up and staff. I call these, the ‘Centres for the Emergence of Discipline of Anthropology in Britain’ (CEDA).\n",
    " \n",
    "## Question 1: ##\n",
    "\n",
    "What can be revealed if a historian uses data science to study a large historical community over a long period of time by bringing together and integrating metadata from catalogues, indexes, and genealogical data?\n",
    " \n",
    "## Methodology: ##\n",
    "\n",
    "I have designed, built and I am now using a suite of open-source and reproducible relational database technologies and digital analytic tools to visualise and scrutinise the entire community of some 3000 activists over 40 years (1830-1870), picking out the Quakers amongst them so that the community can be explored at both group and individual level. I am able to model the ‘connected’ relationships between the individual members of the CEDA through time, including kinship, education, occupations, locations and organisations.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Question 2: ##\n",
    "What is the extent of Quaker involvement in the CEDA, over the 40 year time span researched, and was Quaker kinship as socially cohesive as (say) education or occupation amongst the wider community?\n",

We can also see that the London location contains many members who have no association with any other group (including 'country'). London 1830 - 1870, was densely populated and so it is possible that members of the London location had other modes of association. Because the 'country' location is an aggregate we cannot make the same analysis to the same extent, it is possible that many members in (say) Newcastle had no association with other members in (say) Bristol. We can see the large group of members who were members of both London and 'country' locations. It is highly likely that these members served as conduits of communication and group cohesion.
